# Pattern: Merge Intervals

Following pattern describes efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. Overall, there are 6 ways to the two intervals can relate to each other.
1. 'a' and 'b' do not overlap
2. 'a' and 'b' overlap, 'b' ends after 'a'
3. 'a' completely overlaps 'b'
4. 'a' and 'b' overlap, 'a' ends after 'b'
5. 'b' completely overlaps 'a'
6. 'a' and 'b' do not overlap
