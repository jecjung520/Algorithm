# Problem 2. Number of Distinct Islands - Medium

## Problem
Given a matrix of 0s and 1s, find number of distinct islands.

## Solution - Depth First Search (DFS)
Similar to **Number of Islands** problem. Search for islands of equal traversal. While traversing an island, construct a string that maps the path of island. <br />
