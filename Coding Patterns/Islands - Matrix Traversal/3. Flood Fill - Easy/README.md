## Problem
Given an image represented by a 2D array, flood fill the matrix. Flood fill applies given color to all horizontally and verically connected cells with same color.

## Solution - Depth First Search (DFS)
Similar to **Number of Islands** problem, from a given starting cell, perform DFS to find all connected cells. <br />
