# Coding Patterns

1. [Two Pointers](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Two%20Pointers) - Following pattern utilizes conventional two pointers method to traverse through an array or string. <br/><br/>
2. [Fast and Slow Pointers](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Fast%20and%20Slow%20Pointers) - Following pattern utilizes two pointers advancing at different pace. Typically used to detect cyclical events. <br/><br/>
3. [Matrix Traversal](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Islands%20-%20Matrix%20Traversal) - Following pattern utilizes DFS and BFS to efficiently traverse through 2D array (Matrix). <br/><br/>
4. [Sliding Windows](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Sliding%20Windows) - Following pattern utilizes a window to optimize traversal in an array or a string. <br/><br/>
5. [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Dynamic%20Programming) - Following pattern utilizes Dynamic Programming to reuse overlapping sub-problems. <br>
6. [Top 'K' Numbers](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Top%20K%20Numbers)
7. [Merge Intervals](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Merge%20Intervals)
8. [Backtracking](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Backtracking)
