# Coding Patterns

1. [Two Pointers](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Two%20Pointers)
- Following pattern utilizes conventional two pointers method to traverse through an array or string. <br />
2. [Fast and Slow Pointers](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Fast%20and%20Slow%20Pointers)
- Following pattern utilizes two pointers advancing at different pace. Typically used to detect cyclical events. <br />
3. [Matrix Traversal](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Islands%20-%20Matrix%20Traversal)
- Following pattern utilizes DFS and BFS to efficiently traverse through 2D array (Matrix). <br />
4. [Sliding Windows](https://github.com/jecjung520/Coding-Test-Algorithms/tree/main/Coding%20Patterns/Sliding%20Windows)
- Following pattern utilizes a window to optimize traversal in an array or a string. <br />
